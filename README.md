# POP-UP-s
Custom Windows Pop-Up's just for fun.

# POP-UP's:

I was bored, so I created this. You can customize the pop-up's and troll your friends or just do something nice like a thank you for them.

# Example:

a = msgbox(" Hello World " ,16, "test")

- If you want to add more lines change "a" to any other letter or number.
- If you want to change the text, just change "Hello World" to any other text.
- If you want to change the title, just change "test" to any other word/sentence
- The file can have any name just make sure it's a **vbs** file! (name.vbs)
- If you want a loop just write in the last line loop* (It's endless)
- The number (e.g 16) is for a error pop up. 
  - 16 = error
  - 32 = question
  - 48 = warning
  - 64 = information
